    "\n",
    "Amazon Fraud Detector is a fully managed service that makes it easy to identify potentially fraudulent online activities such as online payment fraud and the creation of fake accounts. Fraud Detector capitalizes on the latest advances in machine learning (ML) and 20 years of fraud detection expertise from AWS and Amazon.com to automatically identify potentially fraudulent activity so you can catch more fraud faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use the Amazon Fraud Detector API to define an entity and event of interest and use CSV data stored in S3 to train a model. Next, we'll derive some rules and create a \"detector\" by combining our entity, event, model, and rules into a single endpoint. Finally, we'll apply the detector to a sample of our data to identify potentially fraudulent events.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running this notebook you should be able to:\n",
    "- Define an Entity and Event\n",
    "- Create a Detector\n",
    "- Train a Machine Learning (ML) Model\n",
    "- Author Rules to identify potential fraud based on the model's score\n",
    "- Apply the Detector's \"predict\" function, to generate a model score and rule outcomes on data\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to know more, please check out [Fraud Detector's Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/frauddetector/). \n",
